                                Second planet from the Sun and our closest planetary neighbor, 
                                Venus is similar in structure and size to Earth, but it is now 
                                a very different world. <br><br>Venus spins slowly in the opposite 
                                direction most planets do. Its thick atmosphere traps heat in a 
                                runaway greenhouse effect, making it the hottest planet in our 
                                solar systemâ€”with surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead. <br><br>
                                Glimpses below the clouds reveal volcanoes and deformed mountains.
