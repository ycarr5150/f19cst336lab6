                                Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the 
                                only place we know of so far that’s inhabited by living things. <br><br>
                                While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, 
                                it is the only world in our solar system with liquid water on 
                                the surface. Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is 
                                the biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which 
                                are made of rock and metal. <br><br>The name Earth is at least 1,000 years old. 
                                All of the planets, except for Earth, were named after Greek and Roman 
                                gods and goddesses. However, the name Earth is a Germanic word, 
                                which simply means “the ground.”
