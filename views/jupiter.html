                                Jupiter has a long history surprising scientists—all the 
                                way back to 1610 when Galileo Galilei found the first moons 
                                beyond Earth. That discovery changed the way we see the universe. <br><br>
                                Fifth in line from the Sun, Jupiter is, by far, the largest 
                                planet in the solar system – more than twice as massive as all 
                                the other planets combined. <br><br>Jupiter's familiar stripes and swirls 
                                are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating 
                                in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter’s iconic Great 
                                Red Spot is a giant storm bigger than Earth that has raged for 
                                hundreds of years.
