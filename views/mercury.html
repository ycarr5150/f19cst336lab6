                                The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun,
                                Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. <br><br>
                                From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times
                                as large as it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as
                                much as seven times brighter. <br><br>Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury
                                is not the hottest planet in our solar system â€“ that title belongs to
                                nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere.
